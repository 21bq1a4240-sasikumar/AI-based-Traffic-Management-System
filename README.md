# AI-Based Traffic Management System 🚦🤖

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **AI-enhanced Traffic Management System** that uses machine learning and data analysis to optimize traffic flow and intelligently manage traffic signals.  
It includes predictions based on traffic data, user authentication, and an interactive interface for controlling or visualizing results.

The system leverages Python, ML models, and real-world data to improve road traffic efficiency.
